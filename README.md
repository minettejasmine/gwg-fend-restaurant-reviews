## Instructions

Welcome to the Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1! To begin, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and begin the user experience.

## Purpose

This project demonstrates how to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. 

Specifically, this project emphasizes how to take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. 

In addition, a service worker is added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

## Requirements

To run the web-application, a web browser is required. A text editor is needed to view the files containing details of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. 

## Contributing

This repository contains a combination of starter code from Udacity and additional code written by Minette J. Roberson. Because this Restaurant Review App is the product of a GWG Udacity FEND Project,  pull requests will most likely not be accepted until further notice.
